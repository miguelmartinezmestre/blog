# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze. In this post, we'll explore some of its key features and why you might want to use it for your next project.

## Key Features

### 1. File-based Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system that makes creating new pages as simple as adding a file to your project:

```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Us</h1>
}
```

### 2. Server-side Rendering

Next.js supports both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box:

```jsx
// SSG example
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData()
  return {
    props: { data }
  }
}
```

### 3. API Routes

You can create API endpoints right in your Next.js application:

```jsx
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello World!' })
}
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```
