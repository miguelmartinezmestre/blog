# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Next.js and MDX. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building websites easier. Some of its features include:

- File-based routing
- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- API routes
- And much more!

Stay tuned for more posts!
